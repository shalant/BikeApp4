# BikeApp4

This app is in development as of 15-Sep-23. It has a decent UI for showing bike routes and events near Oak Park Illinois. It uses ASP.NET Razor Pages with a SQL server DB, deployed on Azure

## Further Development

I plan to make the UI have cool cards everwhere and have an elegant mobile layout, but I'm taking my time making my choices and trying out different elements. Down the road, perhaps I'll make a user experience where someone can enter 3 fields like wind direction, duration, and vigor, and the app will give route options. My friend might help out with some security and/or some smart deployment options.
